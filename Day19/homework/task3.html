        <h3>Mathematics</h3>
        <p>
        Mathematics is a field of study that discovers and organizes methods, theories, and theorems that are developer and proved for the needs of empirical sciences and mathematics itself.</p>
        <p>There are many areas of mathematics, which include number theory, algebra, geometry, analysis and set theory</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Number Theory</h3>
        <p>Number theory is a branch of pure mathematics devoted primarily to the study of the integers and arithmetic functions. Number theorists study prime numbers as well as the properties of mathematical objects constructed from integers (for example, rational numbers), or defined as generalizations of the integers (for example, algebraic integers).</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Geometry</h3>
        <p>Geometry is a branch of mathematics concerned with properties of space such as the distance, shape, size and relative position of figures. Geometry is along with arithmetic, one of the oldest branches of mathematics.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Algebra</h3>
        <p>Algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with abstract systems, known as algebraic structures and the manipulation of expressions within those systems. It is a generalization of arithmetic that introduces variables and algebraic operations other than the standard arithmetic operations, such as addition and multiplication.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Set Theory</h3>
        <p>Set Theory is the branch of mathematical logic tha studies sets, which can be informally described as collections of objects. although objects can be collected into a set, set theory- as a branch of mathematics - is mostly concerned with those that are relevant to mathematics as a whole.</p>

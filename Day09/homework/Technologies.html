        <h2>Artificial Intelligence known as Ai</h2>
        <h3>Ai is the capability of systems to perfom tasks typically associated with solving problems, learning, reasoning, decision making and etc... It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.</h3>

        <h2>Secondly lets continue with computers</h2>

        <h2>Now we have many things to talk about so lets begin</h2>
        <h3>A computer is a machine that can be programmed to automatically carry out sequences of arithmetics or logical operations, Modern digital electronic computers can perfom generic sets of operations known as programs, which enable computers to perfom a wide range of tasks.
        Conventionally, a modern computer consists of at least one processing element, typically a central processing unit (CPU) in the form of a microprocessor, together with some type of computer memory, typically semiconductor memory chips. The processing element carries out arithmetic and logical operations, and a sequencing and control unit can change the order of operations in response to stored information.  Devices can inclidue input devices like keyboards, mouse, joysticks, microphones and etc. and output devices too monitors printers and lot more.</h3>

        <h2>And last i will talk about smartphones</h2>
        <img src="https://www.pngall.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Smartphone-Download-PNG.png">

        <h3>Smartphone has touchscreen interface allowing users to access a wide range  of applications and services such as web browsing, email and social media. Smartphones have built in cameras, GPS navigations and support for various communication methods, including voice calls, text messaging and internet based applications.
